# CIS 552 – Database Normalization & Performance Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes the performance impact of database normalization by comparing
non-normalized CSV-based tables with a fully normalized relational schema in MySQL.

## Dataset
Three dataset sizes were used:
- 1MB
- 10MB
- 100MB

## Methodology
- Raw CSV data loaded directly into MySQL tables
- Normalized schema created using 3NF principles
- Five queries (Q1–Q5) executed on both schemas
- Execution times measured using Python
- Results visualized using Matplotlib

## Queries
- Q1: Simple selection
- Q2: Conditional filtering
- Q3: Highly selective query
- Q4: Aggregation with grouping
- Q5: Aggregation per entity

## Results Summary
- Normalization significantly improves performance for selective and aggregation-heavy queries (Q3–Q5)
- Non-normalized tables perform better for scan-heavy queries (Q1–Q2)
- Indexing greatly improves normalized query performance
  
## Visualization
Performance results are visualized using per-query line graphs generated by `plot_sketch_style.py`,
showing execution time growth for non-normalized data (1MB, 10MB, 100MB) and comparison with
normalized performance at 100MB.

## Tools Used
- MySQL 8.x
- Python 3.14
- pandas
- matplotlib
